GE  OF 
    TODAY THERES ONLY ONE COUNTRY THATS NOT REACHABLE FROM YOUR TELEPHONE
ALBANIA WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE FUTURE OF ESPIONAGE
    YOW WHAT AM I THINKING ABOUT IM NOT A SPY IM JUST AN ASTRONOMER WHOS BEEN
AWAY FROM SCIENCE FOR TOO LONG
    AS I TURNED OFF MY MONITORS AND WOUND UP THE CABLES I REALIZED THAT FOR A
YEAR ID BEEN CAUGHT IN A MAZE ID THOUGHT ID BEEN SETTING TRAPS ACTUALLY ID
BEEN TRAPPED THE WHOLE WHILE WHILE THE HACKER WAS SEARCHING MILITARY COMPUTERS I
WAS EXPLORING DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES ON THE NETWORKS AND IN THE GOVERNMENT HIS
JOURNEY TOOK HIM INTO THIRTY OR FORTY COMPUTERS MINE REACHED INTO A DOZEN
ORGANIZATIONS
    MY OWN QUEST HAD CHANGED I THOUGHT I WAS HUNTING FOR A HACKER ID IMAGINED
THAT MY WORK HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY HOME OR COUNTRY    AFTER ALL I WAS JUST
DOING MY JOB
    NOW WITH MY COMPUTERS SERVICED AND HOLES PATCHED I BIKED HOME PICKED A FEW
STRAWBERRIES AND MIXED SOME MILKSHAKES FOR MARTHA AND CLAUDIA
    CUCKOOS WILL LAY THEIR EGGS IN OTHER NESTS IM RETURNING TO ASTRONOMY
                                                    PAGE  OF 
                                     EPILOGUE
      WHILE I WAS DESPERATELY TRYING TO WRAP UP THE HACKER CHASE WE ALSO HAD A
WEDDING TO PLAN IT WAS A HECTIC TIME AND I CURSED MY WORK AND HESS FOR
DISTRACTING ME FROM MY HOME LIFE WE WERE GOING TO BE MARRIED AT THE END OF MAY SO
THE APRIL REVELATIONS WERE PARTICULARLY AWKWARD MARTHA ENDING UP WITH MORE THAN
HER SHARE OF THE PREPARATIONS
    SHE WAS COPING HOWEVER FIRMLY RESOLVED TO MAKE THE WEDDING TRUE TO WHO WE
WERE WE SILKSCREENED OUR OWN INVITATIONS SAYING THAT THE TWO OF US ALONG WITH
OUR FAMILIES WERE DOING THE INVITING NATURALLY THE INK ON THE SILKSCREEN LEAKED
THROUGH AND HALF THE INVITATIONS HAD OUR FINGERPRINTS BUT THATS A PART OF THE
HOME BREW
    MARTHA DECKED OUT IN A WHITE DRESS AND VEIL AND ME IN A TUX ABSURD AND
LAURIE IN A BRIDESMAIDS OUTFIT NOBODY EVER MADE LAURIE WEAR A DRESS FOR ANY
REASON SOMEHOW WE MANAGED LAURIE WORE WHITE LINEN PANTS AND A TAILORED JACKET
MARTHA MADE A SIMPLE PALE YELLOW DRESS AND I SEWED MY OWN COTTON SHIRT TRY
SEWING YOUR OWN SHIRT SOMETIME YOULL LEARN A NEW RESPECT FOR SHIRT MAKERS
ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU SEW THE CUFFS ON BACKWARD
    SO IT RAINED ON OUR WEDDING AND THERE WASNT A PLACE TO HIDE IN THE ROSE
GARDEN CLAUDIAS STRING QUARTET UNRAVELED A TARP PROTECTING THEIR VIOLINS FROM
THE DOWNPOUR MY SISTER JEANNIE SHOWED UP STRAIGHT FROM HER LAST CLARM AT NAVY WAR
COLLEGE AND STRAIGHT INTO A POLITICAL ARGUMENT WITH LAURIE OF COURSE AFTER THE
CEREMONY WE GOT LOST DRIVING TO A REMOTE INN BY THE OCEAN
    IT WAS WONDERFUL ALL THE SAME SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT MARRIAGE THIS WAS THE
HAPPIEST DAY OF MY LIFE
    SURE I COULD HAVE JUST STAYED LIVING WITH MARTHA NEVER QUITE COMMITTING
MYSELF BEYOND NEXT MONTHS RENT ID LIVED WITH SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS CASUAL
WAY SAYING WE WERE IN LOVE BUT ALWAYS READY TO SPLIT IF THINGS GOT TOUGH WE
DRESSED IT UP WITH TALK ABOUT OPENNESS AND FREEDOM FROM OPPRESSIVE CONVENTIONS BUT
FOR ME IT WAS JUST AN EXCUSE THE TRUTH WAS I HAD NEVER DARED TO GIVE MYSELF FULLY
TO ANYONE COMMITTING MYSELF TO MAKE IT WORK NO MATTER WHAT BUT NOW ID FOUND
SOMEONE I LOVED AND TRUSTED ENOUGH TO GATHER MY COURAGE AND STAND BY NOT JUST FOR
NOW BUT FOREVER
    BUT DOMESTIC HAPPINESS DOESNT SOLVE EVERYTHING I STILL HAD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
TO DO NEXT WITH HESS UNMASKED I COULD RETURN TO ASTRONOMY OR AT LEAST
COMPUTING NOT QUITE TRACKING AN INTERNATIONAL SPY RING BUT THEN THERES RESEARCH
TO DO EVERYWHERE THE BEST PART IS NOT KNOWING WHERE YOUR SCIENCE WILL LEAD YOU
    IT WASNT THE SAME THE COMPUTER PEOPLE FELT ID WASTED THE PAST COUPLE YEARS
RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SPIES THE SPIES DIDNT HAVE MUCH USE FOR ME WHO NEEDS AN
ASTRONOMER AND THE ASTRONOMERS KNEW ID BEEN AWAY FROM THE FIELD FOR TWO YEARS
WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE
    MARTHA HAD PARMED HER BAR EXAM AND WAS CLERKING FOR A JUDGE ACROSS THE BAY IN
SAN FRANCISCO SHE LOVED IT TAKING NOTES ON TRIALS RESEARCHING CASE LAW HELPING
TO WRITE DECISIONS A SORT OF GRAD SCHOOL FOR LAW
    SHE FOUND ANOTHER CLERKSHIP IN BOSTON STARTING IN AUGUST  OVER A
STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKE SHE DESCRIBED HER POSSIBILITIES
    ID CLERK FOR THE CIRCUIT COURT IN BOSTON ITLL BE MORE ACADEMIC THERE NO
                                                    PAGE  OF 
    TRIALS JUST APPEALS MIGHT BE FUN
    AND THE ALTERNATIVES
    WELL IM THINKING ABOUT RETURNING TO SCHOOL TO FINISH MY DEGREE IN
JURISPRUDENCE THATLL TAKE A FEW MORE YEARS ALWAYS THE ACADEMIC
    WOULD I LEAVE BERKELEY TO FOLLOW HER TO MARMACHUSETTS
    SIMPLE DECISION ID FOLLOW HER ANYWHERE IF SHES GOING TO BOSTON ID DREDGE
UP A JOB THERE FORTUNATELY THE HARVARD SMITHSONIAN CENTER FOR ASTROPHYSICS WAS
LOOKING FOR A HALFBREED ASTRONOMERCOMPUTER JOCKEY SOMEONE TO PLAY WITH THEIR X
RAY ASTRONOMY DATABASE
    I CAN MESS UP A DATABASE AS WELL AS THE NEXT PERSON AND THEY DIDNT MIND MY
HIATUS FROM ASTRONOMY AND BEING ASTRONOMERS THEY WERE ALREADY ACCUSTOMED TO
PEOPLE SHOWING UP LATE AND SLEEPING UNDER DESKS
    IT WASNT EASY TO LEAVE BERKELEY THE STRAWBERRIES THE STREET VENDORS THE
SUNSHINE BUT WE SIGNED A NONAGGRESSION PACT WITH OUR ROOMMATES WE COULD VISIT
ANYTIME AND WOULDNT HAVE TO WASH THE DISHES IN RETURN THEY COULD STAY AT OUR
PLACE IN MARMACHUSETTS SO LONG AS THEY BROUGHT SOME CALIFORNIA KIWI FRUIT
    THE HARDEST PART WAS LEAVING OUR ROOMMATE CLAUDIA ID GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO HER
LATENIGHT MOZART PRACTICING A LONG WAY FROM THE BERKELEY GRATEFUL DEAD
CONCERTS
